title:  "Ford Circles"
---

In this project, I use Farey addition to calculate and draw successive generations of Ford circles. For any circle in the project below, the circle is tangent to the horizontal axis at {% katex %}x = \frac{p}{q}{% endkatex %}, with a radius of {% katex %}\frac{1}{2q^{2}}{% endkatex %}.

These circles can be generated by picking any two touching circles, and "adding" their {% katex %}x{% endkatex %} coordinates using Farey addition:

{% katex display %}
\frac{1}{2} \oplus \frac{1}{3} = \frac{(1 + 1)}{(2 + 3)} = \frac{2}{5}
{% endkatex %}

So in the above example, we can see that the circle at {% katex %}x = \frac{1}{2}{% endkatex %} and the circle at {% katex %}x = \frac{1}{3}{% endkatex %} will have a new, smaller circle inscribed between them and the horizontal axis, at {% katex %}x = \frac{2}{5}{% endkatex %}!

Drag the slider to generate successive generations of circles.

Francis Bonahon plays around with Farey addition, and shows its geometric analog, Ford circles.

#### Coding Train: Recursion
Daniel Shiffman discusses recursion, and implements recursion visually using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/). When I saw this video, it gave me the idea to code up the Ford circles from Numberphile in an interactive way, using p5.
