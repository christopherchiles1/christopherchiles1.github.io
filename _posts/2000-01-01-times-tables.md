title:  "Times Tables"
---

An envelope is a curve created by a series of tangent lines. Some fascinating curves can be created by tracing tangent lines as chords on a circle, using the rules of multiplication in modular arithmetic.

In modular arithmetic, operations are done on a circle instead of a number line. Some $n$ points can be wrapped evenly around in a circle, and then a chord can be drawn between any two points, if the points are related under multiplication by $x$.

The demonstration below starts with a modulus of $200$, representing the number of points around the circle, and a multiplier of $2$, representing the multiplier used to draw chords.

A chord is drawn from from the $12th$ point around the circle to the $24th$ point, since they are related under multiplication by $2$.

Similarly, a chord is drawn from the $132nd$ point around the circle to the $64th$ point, since $2 \times 132 = 264 \equiv 64 \pmod{200}$.

Once all chords are drawn, a clear envelope can be seen, forming the shape of a cardioid!

Try out different combinations of modulus and multiplier to see how the image changes.
