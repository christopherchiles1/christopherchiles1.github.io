With three years of comprehensive experience in web development, I have refined an approach to software engineering that is simultaneously thorough, and detail-oriented. I am an expert in Ruby on Rails, and will work tirelessly to apply myself to any codebase with which I am working.

I am passionate about programming as an art-form and a means of creation. I am also interested in STEM education, and in using technology to aid in the teaching process (see [Projects](/)).

### What Iâ€™m looking for
While I am capable of full-stack software development, my passion is developing scalable back-end web applications and services.

I enjoy working in Ruby, however, I am versatile and keen to learn a myriad of programming languages. In my next position, I would like to dive head-first into a new business domain with an application at scale.
