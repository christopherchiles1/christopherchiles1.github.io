With three years of comprehensive experience in web development, I have refined an approach to software engineering that is simultaneously thorough, and detail-oriented. I am an expert in Ruby on Rails, and will work tirelessly to apply myself to any codebase with which I am working.

I am passionate about programming as an art-form and a means of creation. I am also interested in STEM education, and in using technology to aid in the teaching process.
